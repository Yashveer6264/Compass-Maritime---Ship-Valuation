# Shipping Industry Forecasting and Vessel Valuation

## Overview

This project focuses on the examination and forecasting of the shipping industry's size. Multiple linear regression models in R were applied, utilizing a market approach and Manhattan distance to estimate ship prices. The project suggests a market-based price for the 11-year-old cape-size bulk carrier, Bet Performer, identifying the top three predictors for ship pricing using regression models. Intricate interactions among various variables were analyzed, emphasizing the limitations of linear models in vessel valuation, and crucial factors such as the vessel's age at sale, time-charter fees, and fuel efficiency index were identified.
